For this class project I implemented the StringTable methods, creating a hash table data structure.
The other supporting classes and Main method were provided for me, which gave me the input sequences.

I did not use the c++ code provided in any way. For more information on the specifics of my implementation view the Lab 2 ReadMe file.
